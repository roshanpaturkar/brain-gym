# In-order Traversal
In-order traversal is a depth-first traversal method for binary trees. In this method, the nodes are recursively visited in the following order:

1. Traverse the left subtree
2. Visit the root node
3. Traverse the right subtree

This results in the nodes being visited in ascending order for binary search trees.
